// A Model representing Users and Reimbursments
I will need
The Fields: The Variables in an Object that stores its respective Data
Reimbursments: Reimbuesament approval, Reimbursment (ID, author,resolver,description,  Status, Amount )
Users: Type of Employee, User(id,username,password,role), Add Users

Reimbursement Model: The Reimbursement CLASS holds the Int id, String author, Int reslover, String description,
String status, and Int Amount OBJECTS. I used SETTERS on the objects to update the value of their variables.
I used GETTERS to allow the OBJECTS to be read outside of the encapsulated class. For objects that get compiled
I set the possible compilation results with ENUMs.
